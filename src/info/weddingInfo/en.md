intro: >-
  We are so happy to share another special moment in our lives with the ones we
  love. Who would say that Bruno would be brave enough to propose to me one day,
  right?


  This journey started eight years ago and since then we’ve had loads of
  laughing moments, a few tears, learnings and stories to tell, which you were
  part of… and obviously this time wouldn’t be different. So here we are, ready
  to put one more plan in action but this time to become Mr and Mrs Spitti :P.


  This ceremony is not just symbolising our love but also to celebrate life and
  the fact we will have all our most special ones in the same place, even
  because we live so far away and you can’t imagine how much we miss you all.


  Anyway, better late than never! Ready for this one?
